# Serverless Computing for IoT

## Audience
This tutorial is designed for building a computing architecture, based on open-source software,  that allows the users to exploit Function-as-service model in the context of IoT. The idea is provides a system which allows as in Amazon Aws or Microsoft Azure, and so on, to deploy functions that are trigged by events generated from small devices such as sensors and  mobile (IoT devices), commonly these devices communicates using message-passing, in particular on dedicated protocols as AMQP or MQTT.  

The end of this tutorial provides example that deploy a function to log the temperature value received by a sensor on the AMQP protocol, in this example the events are generated by another function executed on the system or outside (this is a semplification, but it is easily to test using a real device that allows to send messages on AMQP protocol).

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Docker 
- Docker Compose
- Nuclio
- RabbitMQ (MQTT plugin Enabled)

## Software Installation on Ubuntu 

### Docker

Install Docker using the Docker CE installation [guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#extra-steps-for-aufs).

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

### Docker Compose
Install Docker Compose using the Docker Compose installation [guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

```
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Nuclio (High-Performance Serverless event and data processing platform)

Start [Nuclio](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio) using docker.

```
docker run -p 8070:8070 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp nuclio/dashboard:stable-amd64
```

### RabbitMQ 

Start [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) instance with MQTT enabled using docker.
```
sudo docker run -p 9000:15672  -p 1818:1818 -p 5672:5672  cyrilix/rabbitmq-mqtt 
```
#### Library for MQTT and MQTT clients

There are different libraries for many languages for interacting with protocol AMQP and MQTT you can use what you want. For JavScript we used this [library](https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node).
